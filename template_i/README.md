## Updates
- Added description for your position and company.
- Update the consistency of the font.
- Moved time aligned with job title on the right hand side (people tend to be read from left to right, so always let them read the more important thing on the left hand side)
- Highlight, italic, bold are added

## The Design

More details and more things to be noticed are in my [Blog](https://levispace.wordpress.com/2018/08/24/resume-template/).
